# Enemy Range Display Plugin

This is the [Enemy Range Display] script by Goinza, modified by me to add red outlines around the enemy range and also add a visual indicator of marked units.

** Requires the UNIT STATE ANIMATOR plugin to work!!! **  It is available from this repository as well.  Make sure that !unit-state-animator.js is loaded before any other .js files.  As long as you don't remove the exclamation mark from the filename, that should be the case.
